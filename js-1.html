        // Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
        // The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
        // The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
        // If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

        // If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
        // If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
        // In this example, price1, price2, iand total, are variables:

        const price1 = 5;
        const price2 = 6;
        let total = price1 + price2;
        console.log("The total is" + " " + total);

        // JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
        // In programming, text values are called text strings.
        // JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
        // Strings are written inside double or single quotes.Numbers are written without quotes.
        // If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
        const pi = 3.14;
        let person = "John Doe";
        let answer = 'Yes I am!';
        console.log(pi + " " + person + " " + answer);

        // Differences between var, let and const

        // var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value. const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value. developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.
